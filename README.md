# Snake Game

A classic implementation of the Snake game built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a simple, browser-based version of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around a bordered area. The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the wall or into its own body.

## How to Play

To run this game, you need to open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Recommended Method: Using a Live Server

For the best experience and to avoid potential browser security issues, it's recommended to run this project using a local web server. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the **Live Server** extension.

1.  Right-click the `index.html` file in VS Code.
2.  Select "Open with Live Server".

### Alternative Method: Direct File Opening

You can also open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. However, some browsers may have security restrictions that could prevent the game from running correctly.
